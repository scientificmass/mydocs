# WSL2 and Neovim problems
## Can't find SumatraPDF executable... [Source](https://medium.com/@Pirmin/a-minimal-latex-setup-on-windows-using-wsl2-and-neovim-51259ff94734)
To make SumatraPDF callable from WSL, rename the SumatraPDF.exe to SumatraPDF and add the installation folder to the %PATH enviroment variable in Windows. You might want to copy the executable to be able to use SumatraPDF under normal Windows as well.
